## 🧠 What You Discovered (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Sentence:

```
I am not happy
```

### Blind stopword removal:

```
['happy']
```

### Meaning flipped ❌

User emotion = ❌ unhappy
AI understanding = ✅ happy

👉 This is called **Semantic Loss**.

## 🔴 Key NLP Lesson (Remember this for life)

> **Not all stopwords are useless.**

Words like:

* not
* never
* no

❌ MUST NOT be removed blindly.

This is why:

* real NLP models
* ChatGPT
* Gemini

👉 don’t use simple stopword lists.

## 🧩 Real-world Connection

This exact problem happens in:

* Sentiment analysis
* Chatbots
* Customer feedback AI

Example:

> “The product is not good”

If AI removes **not**:
👉 “good” → wrong decision 😬
